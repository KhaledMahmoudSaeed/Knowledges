HTML (Hyper text mark up language)
All Html elements (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)
when you named your text editor as index.html your browser will think this page is your home page of your website
** when you have a tag included another one or more you must make indent before any child(the tage below parent tag)
** <span> ....<div>  the diffrence is span is inline elements and div is a block elements so if you write something
between sevral spans it will apper next to each others however div each element appers in one line or one block.... span is
also good and usefull when you want to format a speific text using CSS not a whole paragraph...... but div is the most important 
tag that you ever see because it separate every collection of tags together so that be easy to modify them all in  one line in CSS
** all meta tags used to make your website easier to found by search engine  depends on name of each meta tag  

**<! DOCTYPE html > is so important to your web to be rendered by browser by standered compliance so all contians can be randered
properly not in quirkes mode

** <b>bold text </b>...... <strong> Important text useful and help browser engine</strong>

** <p class=""> named each paragraph by a uniqe name to be able edited by CSS   A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page
** If you want to merge two or more cells in one row in Table you can do it by using <tr colspan="2">done</tr> so here you have mereg two cells
**HTML Entities is how to print tags or speical characters without html compile it like <p> or & etc ... every entitiy starts with & and end wth ; between  them is unique code for your entitiy
** In HTML5 a very useful feature that replaced some of div elements that you have to write without knowing what this div referes to so we have (header,footer,section,main,artical,aside) these is Semantics elemants those
all are normal div but with different names to be better to read ...... instead of using div as container for img and its caption can use figure for all and figcaption for the caption it is the same as div but make more sence
