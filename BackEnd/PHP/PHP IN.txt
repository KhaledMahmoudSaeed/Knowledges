PHP (Hypertext preprocessor) a scripting language that mainly used for web development however it can be used in AI or Mobile
but it isn't a good choice ..... executed on a server not like HTML or CSS or javascript that means you can't easily view code of
your site by just clicking on the site and open it by Atom or VS ..... can be hosted on any server and worked with any database
In HTML you might want to create several pages for each person to show his data that called Static page that would be overwhelming boring
however in PHP you can create one page and grasp up all data and informations about each person frome your database using ID or cookies etc..

..........................................................................
start/end tage in PHP is <? php                  ?>  ## it is a good practice not to wirte the end tag if PHP code is the last
code in your IDE or you write PHP only in your IDE because it may cause problems with output buffer
// or # single line comment........../* */   start and end comment lines
In PHP it determins the data type for each data input or output may be you will write 10+15.5 this is a int + float input data
but the output data will be double ..... 5+'5 lesson' it will return 10 and warning that there a string here note this is just
warning not error ........ 4+'2'   return 6 integer
Casting  (int) or(integer) or ( integer ) .... normal casting just you put the casting word between parentheses
nothe that int+int=int ... int +float or double=double .... float(10.5)+float(10.5) = double(21)
\ for escaping  used if you want compiler ignore the next character and not compile it just print it if in echo
Nowdoc/Heredoc  it used to make escaping for huge code between them but nowdoc make full escape however heredoc make partial
escape ,that is mean if there any variable it derive it if there any \ it execute it 
echo <<<"hgsd"
                              heredock there is a double quotion
hgsf;

echo <<<'hgsd'
			      nowdock there is a single quotion
hgsd;
<pre> this tag print the lines as it like if you write bunch of echo lines it will be appered in several lines as you wrote 
if you enter some escape characters it will be active within this tag

**Loosely  typed language // Reference are not pointer//compile time vs runtime**

first we will learn user variables
to declare a variable use $ then varabile name .... $username="khaled";
to print variable echo $username ; ..... or if you want to put it next to some text use ""     echo " hallo $username ";
note that PHP is case sensetive

variabile variable it means you make your code dynamic and called a variable  by another variable 
$a="kahled"; // first one
$$a="Mahmoud" ;// seconde one 
$$$a="Saeed";// third one and so on 
how to print them there is two methods ... echo $a; ...echo $$a; ..... echo $$$a; or you can write echo $khaled;
or the second method is echo "hall ${$a}";// that is mean second declaration $$a the {} defines a one of $but if you want to call 
$$$$$a just write echo "hallo ${$$$$a}"; //less than number of $ in the decalartion by 1

to make two variable refere to each other just put & before one of them like that $b=&$a; 
if you change the value of a or b at any time both will be changed because refrence
second we will learn pre_defined variable : this is some variables that is built in the language you can sereach about it 

constants : to declare a constant use define("CONSTANT_NAME","CONSTANT_VALUE");..... define("DB_NAME","Lelouch"); or define("MAIN_NUMBER",4);
it is best practice to name your constant by Upper case letters

there are some pre-defined constant as vairables you can search for them and search for reserved words like break-continue-clone

(identity)  +$a ...(negation) -$a  
these two arithmetic opertators make the text as a number if all of them are actually as number not string or mixed
but -$a make somthing extra which is getting the opposite if it is positive return the negative 

comparison operators  == and != or<> compar value only however === and !== compar value and datatype (identical comparison operators)
<=> called spaceship it is a very cool copmarison operator it return -1 if first value is smaller ,0 if equal and 1 if bigger than second value 
 $a++ post increment...... ++$a Pre increment
Logic Precedence it means which one if these logic operator will be executed first 
&& has great precedence than and ...... || has great precedence than or  
it also works with other operators like = or == or any logic operator  try type $a= 10 || false ....$a= 10 or false
PHP logic operators are  and, &&,or,||,xor,!
xor: if one is true but not both   (لو مختلفين يرجع واحد لو متشابهين يرجع صفر )

Concatenate string : using . to merge two strings , variables, funcations and constants even a space " "with each others

as you know comparison between two arrays happens in three aspects value, datatype and order if you use a normal comparison
operator  will check only the value for all keys and their values otherwise using an identical comparison operator will check value, datatype and order
#Note that + operator can be used between arrays make a Union array

to prevent showing error massage use @ before line or place that you expect it will throw an error

inserting html tags inbetween php is a optimal way to write to make sure editor will see html tages and check syntax and color ..etc
like that
<?php if(true) {?>
<p>hallo world</p>
<?php }?> 



...............................................
Built In funcations
echo " " ...echo ' '  = print ' ' ..... print " "  there is no diffrence between all of them
gettype() 	to know which type this data belongs to as int or string whatever  .... gettype([121,442,51]) it will return arry just like gettype(arr(121,442,51))
var_dump()	converting to bool if the value between parentheses true it return bool(true) otherwise bool(false)
nl2br()  	insert <br> after each line you will enter because in PHP it consider all you wrote however it in serval line as sigle line
strtolower("") ,strtoupper(""), strlen(), str_replace("","") ,substr("", starting index,howmany character you want you can let this palce blank whenever it means from starting index to end)
abs(),pow(num,power),sqrt(),max(),min(),round(),ceil(),floor(),
