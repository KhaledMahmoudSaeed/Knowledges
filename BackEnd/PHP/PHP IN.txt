`PHP (Hypertext preprocessor) a scripting language that mainly used for web development however it can be used in AI or Mobile
but it isn't a good choice ..... executed on a server not like HTML or CSS or javascript that means you can't easily view code of
your site by just clicking on the site and open it by Atom or VS ..... can be hosted on any server and worked with any database
In HTML you might want to create several pages for each person to show his data that called Static page that would be overwhelming boring
however in PHP you can create one page and grasp up all data and informations about each person frome your database using ID or cookies etc..

..........................................................................
start/end tage in PHP is <? php                  ?>  ## it is a good practice not to wirte the end tag if PHP code is the last
code in your IDE or you write PHP only in your IDE because it may cause problems with output buffer
// or # single line comment........../* */   start and end comment lines
In PHP it determins the data type for each data input or output may be you will write 10+15.5 this is a int + float input data
but the output data will be double ..... 5+'5 lesson' it will return 10 and warning that there a string here note this is just
warning not error ........ 4+'2'   return 6 integer
Casting  (int) or(integer) or ( integer ) .... normal casting just you put the casting word between parentheses
nothe that int+int=int ... int +float or double=double .... float(10.5)+float(10.5) = double(21)
\ for escaping  used if you want compiler ignore the next character and not compile it just print it if in echo
Nowdoc/Heredoc  it used to make escaping for huge code between them but nowdoc make full escape however heredoc make partial
escape ,that is mean if there any variable it derive it if there any \ it execute it 
echo <<<"hgsd"
                              heredock there is a double quotion
hgsf;

echo <<<'hgsd'
			      nowdock there is a single quotion
hgsd;
<pre> this tag print the lines as it like if you write bunch of echo lines it will be appered in several lines as you wrote 
if you enter some escape characters it will be active within this tag
============================================
to get access to element in array  array[day] or array-> day when day is a index 
==============================================

.......................................................
**Loosely  typed language // Reference are not pointer//compile time vs runtime**

first we will learn user variables
to declare a variable use $ then varabile name .... $username="khaled";
to print variable echo $username ; ..... or if you want to put it next to some text use ""     echo " hallo $username ";
note that PHP is case sensetive

variabile variable it means you make your code dynamic and called a variable  by another variable 
$a="kahled"; // first one
$$a="Mahmoud" ;// seconde one 
$$$a="Saeed";// third one and so on 
how to print them there is two methods ... echo $a; ...echo $$a; ..... echo $$$a; or you can write echo $khaled;
or the second method is echo "hall ${$a}";// that is mean second declaration $$a the {} defines a one of $but if you want to call 
$$$$$a just write echo "hallo ${$$$$a}"; //less than number of $ in the decalartion by 1

to make two variable refere to each other just put & before one of them like that $b=&$a; 
if you change the value of a or b at any time both will be changed because refrence
second we will learn pre_defined variable : this is some variables that is built in the language you can sereach about it 

constants : to declare a constant use define("CONSTANT_NAME","CONSTANT_VALUE");..... define("DB_NAME","Lelouch"); or define("MAIN_NUMBER",4);
it is best practice to name your constant by Upper case letters

there are some pre-defined constant as vairables you can search for them and search for reserved words like break-continue-clone

(identity)  +$a ...(negation) -$a  
these two arithmetic opertators make the text as a number if all of them are actually as number not string or mixed
but -$a make somthing extra which is getting the opposite if it is positive return the negative 

comparison operators  == and != or<> compar value only however === and !== compar value and datatype (identical comparison operators)
<=> called spaceship it is a very cool copmarison operator it return -1 if first value is smaller ,0 if equal and 1 if bigger than second value 
 $a++ post increment...... ++$a Pre increment
Logic Precedence it means which one if these logic operator will be executed first 
&& has great precedence than and ...... || has great precedence than or  
it also works with other operators like = or == or any logic operator  try type $a= 10 || false ....$a= 10 or false
PHP logic operators are  and, &&,or,||,xor,!
xor: if one is true but not both   (لو مختلفين يرجع واحد لو متشابهين يرجع صفر )

Concatenate string : using . to merge two strings , variables, funcations and constants even a space " "with each others

as you know comparison between two arrays happens in three aspects value, datatype and order if you use a normal comparison
operator  will check only the value for all keys and their values otherwise using an identical comparison operator will check value, datatype and order
#Note that + operator can be used between arrays make a Union array

to prevent showing error massage use @ before line or place that you expect it will throw an error

inserting html tags inbetween php is a optimal way to write to make sure editor will see html tages and check syntax and color ..etc
like that
<?php if(true) {?>
<p>hallo world</p>
<?php }?> 

in php you can write if statments in two way ... 
if(){				if() : 
}				endif;
ternary condition(short if) used when you want to put a condition between same line or in line that will be more useful otherwise ordainry if used alone in block or line
condition ?true:false
in php you can write while loop in two way ... 
if(){				while() : 
}				endwhile;

foreach($arrt as $value){ between parenthese you can print what you want form the arry that you have been mentioned and the value note that you can 
name $value as you wish }
if you want to deal with key and value too use foreach($arry as $key =>$value)

include() .. require() both get values from external file to your currently file ,but if there an erorr in your file path it will return warning and still scripty works
otherwise with require it will return fatal error and stop working .... include_once() it is the same as require_once() ... it mean this file only once time include this file
if I try to call it again don't call it
### some important names when you start creating a fun like function say(parameter /variable) and when you call it say(argument/value)
in PHP functions always return NULL if you use it in echo error will happen this is default however you want to catch a value from your fun
and deal with it in another palce so you must write return the your returned value
to put default vaules for your variables in fun , just set these values in the beginningg of fun like that function say($name="no one",$num,$dad)
if you want to print these default vaules just enter others value however it will make some errors because fun deals with parameter one by one
so if you don't write first value and write the second one copmiler will asign that value to first parameter and so on until you found the last one
has no value ,,to over come this problem you must write which parameter you want to asgin your values like that(num:4)
 
as we learn variable variable there is a variable function too 
by default fun works by value if you want it to change to by reference mode put & before your argeument function say(&$num)
to force fun to exit an output with a specifi data type value initialize it in fun definition function say($num,$num) :int{}
 
if you want to call a variable to use in fun but it is out of fun scope use use() keyword like that function say($num,$country) use($land){} then you can use $land in your fun

Anonymous fun is a nameless fun used one time for a certian task usually used in another fun called high order like array_map

echo '<pre>';
echo array_map(function($items){ return $nums *5} , $nums) here $nums is an array has some numbers which I want to multiply them by 5
echo '</pre>';
to simplify  Anonymous fun we use Arrow fun look at the previous fun 
array_map(fn($items) =>$nums*5,$nums)
note that arrow fun dosen't want use keyword
##########
string
strlen()			it is allwoable to write -ve between bracktes of string variable to get letters but form the end $str[-1] will get the last letter
lcfirst() .x. ucfirst()		make first letter small of first word
strtolower() .x. strtoupper()	make all letters small or capital
ucwords().....ucwords(,)	make first letter for all words capital ... make first letter of each sentence capital ,it determine the sentence depend on character that you write after ,			 
str_repeat()			repeat str for certian times	
implode(seprator,string)	you have an array and want to spilt it to bunch of pieces depend on your seprator(what you want to seprate between words) not required 
explode(seprator,string,limit)	you have words and want them in array must tell what is your seperator ... limit is optional because it determines how many words you want to be seperated if you write 3 words and specify limit to 1 it will return 2 valuse the first is first word second will be second and third word ... if you write -ve number that means you will reject bunch of words from the end of arry 
str_shuffle()			randoms characters
strrev()			reveres string
trim(string,character)		ignore spaces or tab in string ... you can determine which character to be remove but it must to be at the end of stirng either right or left because trim removes from the end to in like barber
rtrim() .x. ltrim		trime right only or left only
chunk_split(string,len,end)	splits string into pieces depends on len and ends with your end character that you determine (optional)
str_split(string,len)		same but output in array form
strip_tags(,allowable tages)	remove all HTML tags unless you put any tage after, so it will passed and impelement
strpos(string,vlaue,start,end)[case sensitve]	search for first existence value in your string.... start and end can be -ve number it works as strpos count from the end and then start searching
strrpos(string,vlaue,start,end)[case sensitve]	the same but return the last existance of value
stripos(string,vlaue,start,end)[ not case sensitve]
strripos(string,vlaue,start,end)[ not case sensitve]
substr_count(string,value,start,end) how many times value existence 
parse_str(string,array)		get from you query like that comes from get method and put them in array
quotemeta(string)		escaping all speical charater which user entered in search box or input field that may cause problem or be dangerous on your database
str_pad(string,len,adding,flag)	put "adding" next to string until reach the length so that become all strings have same length.. you have 3 types of flage there are {STR_PAD_BOTH,,STR_PAD_LEFT,,STR_PAD_RIGHT} 
strtr(string,form,to)		find and replace
strtr(strign,array)		if there more than one letter need to be replace ..just make an array with these letter and what to be replaced
str_replace(from,to,string,replace count variable)	the same as strtrbut it case sensitive
str_ireplace(from,to,string,replace count variable)	not case sensitive
substr_replace(string,repalaced string,start,len)	if you put len -ve it will add some characters depend on the number of length but from the end if you want to insert not replace put 0 in len place
wordwrap(string,width,break_char,cutlen)		it will put word in the specifi width if the word is less than may another word comes with it in same block unless it will be lonly in line if you asign cut_long true it will cut any long text that cross the line
ord() .x. chr() 					to&from ASCII code
similar_text(string,string,$)				how many funs are similar... in variable stored % of simialr
strstr(string,search,before_search[false])		search for a letter and print what after letter include the letter that is happen if the before_serach false if true will print want before only
number_format(number,decimal,decimal char,intchar)	format number note that if you print  10_000_000 output will be 10000000
...........................................................
Array
array_chunk(arry,number for each arry,preserve key)	to spilt arry to bunch of small arries with key start with 0 regardless what is the key  
array_change_key_case(arry,case upper)			to change key case ... second field is optional once you write it you will turn all letters to upper case
array_combine(array keys,array values)			combine two arrays
array_count_values(array)				count of each element of arrya
array_reverse(array,preserve{bool})			if true will arrange indexes of new reversed array otherwise save the indexes of each one					
array_flip(array)					exchange key with value
count(array,mode)					if mode =0 doesn't count element of multidimensional array but 1 do that and its array too
in_array(search,array,type)				check if value is exist in an array ,if you put true in type will search for the same time
array_key_exists(key,array)				check if key exists
array_keys(array,value,type)				return array keys if you don't specify for which value or type it will return all keys in array
array_values(array)					return values 
array_pad(array,size,value)				to fill array with value until reaches size ,,if size is -ve will fill free spaces too but puts them before existance values ...if size is small then array items it will return orignal array
array_product(array)					multiply all array element
array_sum(array)					sum all array element	
current/next/prev/reset/end(array)			move pointer along the array the default place for pointer is frist item
array_merge(array,array)				merge two arrays if there is same key in the both of them second array will override the first ,,if you used numbering key fun will reset all these numbers to 0,1,2,3 and so one so no override will occur
array_replace(array,replacement array)			the same like array_merge but if one element exists in second array and doesnot exist in first it will be created and unlike merge if you use numbering key it won't reset the number and work normaly
array_rand(array,num)					pick one or more keys from array depens on the num you enter and it will return as array
shuffle(array)						shuffle array
array_shift(array)					shift an element off the beginning of array and reset indexes
array_pop(array)					the same thing but bring the last element 
array_push(array,value, , , , )				append element into end of array we used this fun to append more than element if you want to append one element use $arry[]="element";
array_unshift(array,value, , , , )			add elements at the beginnig of array 	
array_slice(array,start,len,preserve_key)		like chunk ..we can use -ve in start and we know this but  if you use -ve in len slice won't include these elements..if preserve key is true slice will have the same key of its slices
array_splice(array,start,len,array)			the same but the changes apply in the main array ,,if you add an another array of elements or even one element it will include where the slice occurs
sort(array,flag)					ascending order			
rsort(array,flag)					descending order			
asort(array,flag)					like sort but sort is to the value
arsort(array,flag)					like rsort but sort is to the value
ksort(array,flag)					like sort but sort is to the key
krsort(array,flag)					like rsort but sort is to the key
natsort(array,flag)					sort array to make logical
array_map(callback fun,array,others arrays)		higher order fun... applies fun on one array if fun want one argeument if it wants more so it must to derive another arry
array_filter(array,callbackfun,flag)			higher order fun...applies fun on value of array because flag is 0 if you want to apply fun on key put ARRAY_FILTER_USE_KEY instead of 0 if you want to apply fun on key and value use ARRAY_FILTER_USE_BOTH but in all conditions fun will return whole field key with value
array_reduce(array,callbackfun,initial value)		higher order fun...applies fun on array and return single value
...............................................
Math fun
abs()
rand(min,max)/mt_rand()
mt-getrandmax()
intdiv(,)						return always int
fmod()							return always double ...so useful when you type 11.5%5 it will return 1.5 in fmod
ceil()							Top		return doubel
floor()							Bottom		return doubel
round(num,precision,mode)				precision means how many decimal numbers you want ...mod controls roles of round to what will be rounded PHP_ROUND_HALF_(UP,DOWN,EVEN,OOD)	return doubel
sqrt()
min(),max()						you can derive array or just some numbers,,, if you derive two arrays it will compare all corresponds number when it finds array satisfy max or min will return it regardless the rest of numbers
...............................................
Filter
filter_List()						valid filters in system or in language
filter_id()						return  id of datatype like ASCII
filter_var(variable,filter_id _or its name,options(flag))in php filter consider 1 ||"true"||"yes"||"on" all of them as true.......if you enter anything expect those valuse it will return flase even normal string so to prevent this write FILTER_NULL_ON_FAILURE this is a flag return null if you enter a  normal string 						
names of  validate filters are ( FILTER_VALIDATE_(INT,BOOL,FLOAT,URL,EMAIL,IP,MAC)
....sanitize filter....
names(FILTER_SANITIZE_(EMAIL,INT,URL,FLOAT)

flags that you used(NULL_ON_FAILUER,FLAG_PATH_REQUIRED,FLAG_QUERY_REQUIRED,FLAG_IPV4,FLAG_IPV6)
options that you used (FILTER_SANITIZE_ALLOW_THOUSAND,FILTER_SANITIZE_ALLOW_FRACTION,min_range,maxrange)
if you want use more than one flag or option put them into array ["flags"=> NULL_ON_FAILUER | FLAG_PATH_REQUIRED ,"options"=>["min_range"=>50 ,"max_range"=>100] 
sanitize remove all unwanted chars like unless   in 
email	 	+digits+ !#$%&'*+-=?^_`{|}~@.[]
int		+ -
float		+ - that is because sanitize consider int or float as string

there is another fun like filter_var() called filter_input(type,value,filter,options and flags)
types are (INPUT_GET,INPUT_POST,INPUT_COOKIE,INPUT_SERVER,INPUT_ENV)

Built In funcations
echo " " ...echo ' '  = print ' ' ..... print " "  there is no diffrence between all of them
gettype() 	to know which type this data belongs to as int or string whatever  .... gettype([121,442,51]) it will return arry just like gettype(arr(121,442,51))
var_dump()	converting to bool if the value between parentheses true it return bool(true) otherwise bool(false)
nl2br()  	insert <br> after each line you will enter because in PHP it consider all you wrote however it in serval line as sigle line
strtolower("") ,strtoupper(""), strlen(), str_replace("","") ,substr("", starting index,howmany character you want you can let this palce blank whenever it means from starting index to end)
abs(),pow(num,power),sqrt(),max(),min(),round(),ceil(),floor(),
echo PHP_EOL
fun_num_args() return # of your arguments that you will recive if you don't know how many are they exactly
fun_get_arg(index) PHP consider recivied nums as an arry to get ant of them just enter its index
fun_get_args()if you want the main arry use this built in fun
###Spread(splat) Syntas   is a very useful method to deal with funs that you don't know number of arguments you will receive like that function say(...nums) return an arry of arguments
the ... make a unpacking for your array so you can be able to deal with them as single variable
###strln() return how many characters in your string
###function_exists() return true or false
