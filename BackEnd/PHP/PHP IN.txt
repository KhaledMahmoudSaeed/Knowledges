PHP (Hypertext preprocessor) a scripting language that mainly used for web development however it can be used in AI or Mobile
but it isn't a good choice ..... executed on a server not like HTML or CSS or javascript that means you can't easily view code of
your site by just clicking on the site and open it by Atom or VS ..... can be hosted on any server and worked with any database
In HTML you might want to create several pages for each person to show his data that called Static page that would be overwhelming boring
however in PHP you can create one page and grasp up all data and informations about each person frome your database using ID or cookies etc..

..........................................................................
start/end tage in PHP is <? php                  ?>  ## it is a good practice not to wirte the end tag if PHP code is the last
code in your IDE or you write PHP only in your IDE because it may cause problems with output buffer
// or # single line comment........../* */   start and end comment lines
In PHP it determins the data type for each data input or output may be you will write 10+15.5 this is a int + float input data
but the output data will be double ..... 5+'5 lesson' it will return 10 and warning that there a string here note this is just
warning not error ........ 4+'2'   return 6 integer
Casting  (int) or(integer) or ( integer ) .... normal casting just you put the casting word between parentheses
nothe that int+int=int ... int +float or double=double .... float(10.5)+float(10.5) = double(21)
\ for escaping  used if you want compiler ignore the next character and not compile it just print it if in echo
Nowdoc/Heredoc  it used to make escaping for huge code between them but nowdoc make full escape however heredoc make partial
escape ,that is mean if there any variable it derive it if there any \ it execute it 
echo <<<"hgsd"
                              heredock there is a double quotion
hgsf;

echo <<<'hgsd'
			      nowdock there is a single quotion
hgsd;
<pre> this tag print the lines as it like if you write bunch of echo lines it will be appered in several lines as you wrote 
if you enter some escape characters it will be active within this tag
.......................................................
**Loosely  typed language // Reference are not pointer//compile time vs runtime**

first we will learn user variables
to declare a variable use $ then varabile name .... $username="khaled";
to print variable echo $username ; ..... or if you want to put it next to some text use ""     echo " hallo $username ";
note that PHP is case sensetive

variabile variable it means you make your code dynamic and called a variable  by another variable 
$a="kahled"; // first one
$$a="Mahmoud" ;// seconde one 
$$$a="Saeed";// third one and so on 
how to print them there is two methods ... echo $a; ...echo $$a; ..... echo $$$a; or you can write echo $khaled;
or the second method is echo "hall ${$a}";// that is mean second declaration $$a the {} defines a one of $but if you want to call 
$$$$$a just write echo "hallo ${$$$$a}"; //less than number of $ in the decalartion by 1

to make two variable refere to each other just put & before one of them like that $b=&$a; 
if you change the value of a or b at any time both will be changed because refrence
second we will learn pre_defined variable : this is some variables that is built in the language you can sereach about it 

constants : to declare a constant use define("CONSTANT_NAME","CONSTANT_VALUE");..... define("DB_NAME","Lelouch"); or define("MAIN_NUMBER",4);
it is best practice to name your constant by Upper case letters

there are some pre-defined constant as vairables you can search for them and search for reserved words like break-continue-clone

(identity)  +$a ...(negation) -$a  
these two arithmetic opertators make the text as a number if all of them are actually as number not string or mixed
but -$a make somthing extra which is getting the opposite if it is positive return the negative 

comparison operators  == and != or<> compar value only however === and !== compar value and datatype (identical comparison operators)
<=> called spaceship it is a very cool copmarison operator it return -1 if first value is smaller ,0 if equal and 1 if bigger than second value 
 $a++ post increment...... ++$a Pre increment
Logic Precedence it means which one if these logic operator will be executed first 
&& has great precedence than and ...... || has great precedence than or  
it also works with other operators like = or == or any logic operator  try type $a= 10 || false ....$a= 10 or false
PHP logic operators are  and, &&,or,||,xor,!
xor: if one is true but not both   (لو مختلفين يرجع واحد لو متشابهين يرجع صفر )

Concatenate string : using . to merge two strings , variables, funcations and constants even a space " "with each others

as you know comparison between two arrays happens in three aspects value, datatype and order if you use a normal comparison
operator  will check only the value for all keys and their values otherwise using an identical comparison operator will check value, datatype and order
#Note that + operator can be used between arrays make a Union array

to prevent showing error massage use @ before line or place that you expect it will throw an error

inserting html tags inbetween php is a optimal way to write to make sure editor will see html tages and check syntax and color ..etc
like that
<?php if(true) {?>
<p>hallo world</p>
<?php }?> 

in php you can write if statments in two way ... 
if(){				if() : 
}				endif;
ternary condition(short if) used when you want to put a condition between same line or in line that will be more useful otherwise ordainry if used alone in block or line
condition ?true:false
in php you can write while loop in two way ... 
if(){				while() : 
}				endwhile;

foreach($arrt as $value){ between parenthese you can print what you want form the arry that you have been mentioned and the value note that you can 
name $value as you wish }
if you want to deal with key and value too use foreach($arry as $key =>$value)

include() .. require() both get values from external file to your currently file ,but if there an erorr in your file path it will return warning and still scripty works
otherwise with require it will return fatal error and stop working .... include_once() it is the same as require_once() ... it mean this file only once time include this file
if I try to call it again don't call it
### some important names when you start creating a fun like function say(parameter /variable) and when you call it say(argument/value)
in PHP functions always return NULL if you use it in echo error will happen this is default however you want to catch a value from your fun
and deal with it in another palce so you must write return the your returned value
to put default vaules for your variables in fun , just set these values in the beginningg of fun like that function say($name="no one",$num,$dad)
if you want to print these default vaules just enter others value however it will make some errors because fun deals with parameter one by one
so if you don't write first value and write the second one copmiler will asign that value to first parameter and so on until you found the last one
has no value ,,to over come this problem you must write which parameter you want to asgin your values like that(num:4)
 
as we learn variable variable there is a variable function too 
by default fun works by value if you want it to change to by reference mode put & before your argeument function say(&$num)
to force fun to exit an output with a specifi data type value initialize it in fun definition function say($num,$num) :int{}
 
if you want to call a variable to use in fun but it is out of fun scope use use() keyword like that function say($num,$country) use($land){} then you can use $land in your fun

Anonymous fun is a nameless fun used one time for a certian task usually used in another fun called high order like array_map

echo '<pre>';
echo array_map(function($items){ return $nums *5} , $nums) here $nums is an array has some numbers which I want to multiply them by 5
echo '</pre>';
to simplify  Anonymous fun we use Arrow fun look at the previous fun 
array_map(fn($items) =>$nums*5,$nums)
note that arrow fun dosen't want use keyword





...............................................
Built In funcations
echo " " ...echo ' '  = print ' ' ..... print " "  there is no diffrence between all of them
gettype() 	to know which type this data belongs to as int or string whatever  .... gettype([121,442,51]) it will return arry just like gettype(arr(121,442,51))
var_dump()	converting to bool if the value between parentheses true it return bool(true) otherwise bool(false)
nl2br()  	insert <br> after each line you will enter because in PHP it consider all you wrote however it in serval line as sigle line
strtolower("") ,strtoupper(""), strlen(), str_replace("","") ,substr("", starting index,howmany character you want you can let this palce blank whenever it means from starting index to end)
abs(),pow(num,power),sqrt(),max(),min(),round(),ceil(),floor(),
echo PHP_EOL
fun_num_args() return # of your arguments that you will recive if you don't know how many are they exactly
fun_get_arg(index) PHP consider recivied nums as an arry to get ant of them just enter its index
fun_get_args()if you want the main arry use this built in fun
###Spread(splat) Syntas   is a very useful method to deal with funs that you don't know number of arguments you will receive like that function say(...nums) return an arry of arguments
the ... make a unpacking for your array so you can be able to deal with them as single variable
###strln() return how many characters in your string
###function_exists() return true or false
