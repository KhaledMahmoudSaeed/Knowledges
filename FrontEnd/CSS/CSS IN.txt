CSS (Cascade Style Sheet)
{} (curly braces

if you want format all elements 
selector{						p{		
propertry: value;						color:red;	
}							}
if you want fromat certain element/s by thier class insted  of p use .class_name or use id (bad practice) #id

to include CSS file in html you have 3 types 
1- external file <link rel="stylesheet" href="css path">
2-internal file <style></style>
##those two ways have same code but one in same page with HTML and the another is outside
3-in line (bad practice because HTML code usally is templet and hard to modify but is the strogest code that not affected by external or internal file 
if you format all paragraghs in external file and fromat one line using in line format you will see this line is different from the rest
## class and id called identifier................THE BEST PRACTICE TO WRITE using Camel case it is a writing way which used - to separate between each word
..................
background-color:(rgb(0 0 0)/#FF00FF/color-name);
background-image:url();				background-repeat:{repeat/norepeat/repeat-x/repeat-y}
background-attachment:{scroll/fixed}		background--position:{left left/100px 200px/50% 50%} you can change values of pos left,right,top,center,bottom
background-size:{cover(cut)/contain(no cut)}
...................
padding:top right bottom left ...... if if you right one value ot will asign to all directions if you write 2 valus it will asign every opposite direction with the same value
padding-bottom:10px to one direction
margin:{outting padding } can value auto
...................
border-{color/width/style/radius}
or summary all them(short hand) 		border:10px solid red;
...................
span apply padding&margin in left&right only ,,,,if there is any element under it and you increase span's size it will override the under element
there is a useful property that change the mode it called ((display))
display:(block/inline/inline-block/none)
visiblity:(hidden)
the difference between visibility:hidden and display:none is display hide block and remove its place there is no indicate that there is an element here not like visibility
..................
to make group of selector put all classes and seperate between them by , and put {} and write code
><><
we can make nesting when we call parent then his child like that  div p{} or div .speical{} or div .child .field{}
...................
deminsions
min-width/max-width /width:fit-content ...min-height/max-height
..................
overflow:{visibile/hidden/scroll/auto}
auto(best practice) like scroll but it propotional with size of text and div if there overflow scroll will appare otherwise no 
overflow-x/overflow-y :hidden
.................
text-align:{left/right/center}
direction:{rtl/ltr}				to make sence when read AR or ENG
vertical-align:{top/bottom/middel} 		where text will exist repect to img
text-decoration:none 				used to add lines or remove it but we usually used it to remove line under links	
text-transform:{capitalize/uppercase/lowercase}
letter-spacing:2px	word-spacing:2px
text-indent:10px				like padding but more specific used often in codes
line-height:1.6 or 160%	
white-space:nowrap 				make text continue out of div box
word-break:{normal/break-all/break-word}	make breaks in text to fit in div box 
text-overflow:ellipsis				when you used overflow:hidden used text-overflow too to indicate that there is a hidden text here
text-shadow:2px 2px 3px red			first you adjust h-shadow then virtical then blur ther color ... if you want more than one shadow put , and write second shadow's property
..................
inherit 
very useful property in CSS used logicaly between parent and child ,it means between two elements within each others
by default some properties will be inherited like text-align or font-size logically it must but if ypu want more than these
properties to be inherited just write property and asign to it inherit but it must be child like that .d .cho{}
...................
web safe fonts 
font-family:{familys}				it is best practice to asign more than family ,wheather ones isn't provided in this site will use another one that you except
go to google font to find a good font familys
font-size:num {em /rem /vm/%}			em =>time how many time will these font appare repect to parent...rem => same logic but repect to the root which is HTML tag ... vm=> most useful one which its font size respects to window
font-style:{italic/....}
font-variant:{small-caps}
font-weight:bold/normal;
cursor:{clicker/grab/move}			to change cursor shape
.......................
float:{left/right}				makesyour elemenets flow in page
clear:both					uesd with empty element after float to adjust it
calc() 						to calculate any number you want to asign to any property evern used precentage or precentage with pixel ((100% -50)/5)
opacity:					used like alpha in background but it applies Transparency at both text and color
.....................
position:{relative/absoulte/static/fixed/sticky}difference between relative and absoulte is the first one move one the website repect to itself or container but absoulte moves respect to its parent
to control position use {top/right/bottom/left}	note that if you didn't asign any position to absoulte it will move if  you add any margin to another element.... static doesn't move 					
sticky 		like fixed position but under condition relative to your scroll when you come to a specific place depends on top right,left and bottom it will continue with you alonge the screen
fixed		pined in some point and doesn't move under any condition even you scroll up or down
static		doesn't effect with  top right,left and bottom
transform: translate(number-x,number-y)		move  50% elemenet left and top referes to curruntly axis

z-index:{number}				higher number will be above lower number .... must be position property for z-index to work
..................
list-style:none + padding-left:0 +margin:0	useful if you want a list of items that is appera in navegation bar if they consist of some elements in there you can ues unorder list too
..................
to format tabel or its cells or head cell write		table td{}     or     	table thead{}
..................
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
...................
pseudo class
selector : state{
}
state {visited ,hover,checked,link,empty,foucs} 
if you don't write any selector it will apply all selector that staisfy the state

pseudo element
.class :: state{
}
state{first-line,first-letter,selection,before,after}

to active pseudo element must write content: " "; 
you can modify it to display text from attribute when you add an attribute in HTML then put it in 
content : attr(data-text); 
another somting you can add counter from counter-increment : any name then put this name in content :counter(the name);
you can also hidden the content and display when you hover item like that .one:hover::before{display block;} that is mean when you hover class one display content before
